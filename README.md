Elements of Programming Interviews, My answers in different languages (mostly Go)

## Background

As lately my daily job is not an engineering position, I'm trying to keep myself in shape for the case I eventually decide to get back to a position that involves mostly coding (and coding interviews)

I also hope this can help people trying to work on their skills and need hints on how to solve the problems. Please don't just copy and paste the answers as that would not be helping anyone (Actually you're missing the opportunity to learn something)
